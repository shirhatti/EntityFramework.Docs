# Getting Started on ASP.NET Core

> [!WARNING]
> This documentation is for EF Core. For EF6.x and earlier release see [http://msdn.com/data/ef](http://msdn.com/data/ef).

These 101 tutorials require no previous knowledge of Entity Framework (EF) or Visual Studio. They will take you step-by-step through creating a simple application that queries and saves data from a database.

Entity Framework can create a model based on an existing database, or create a database for you based on your model. The following tutorials will demonstrate both of these approaches using an ASP.NET Core application.

## Available Tutorials

* [ASP.NET Core Application to New Database](new-db.md)

* [ASP.NET Core Application to Existing Database (Database First)](existing-db.md)
